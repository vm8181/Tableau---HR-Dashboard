#### 🔹 Demographics

- Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
- Show the total number of employees within each age group.
- Show the total number of employees within each education level.
- Present the correlation between employees’ educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

#### 🔹 Income Analysis
- Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
